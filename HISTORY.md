## 1.0.0 (Oct 7 2022)
New major release

APSG has been significantly refactored from version 1.0 and several changes are
breaking backward compatibility. The main APSG namespace provides often-used
classes in lowercase names as aliases to `PascalCase` convention used in
modules to provide a simplified interface for users. The `PascalCase` names of
classes use longer and plain English names instead acronyms for better
readability.

See documentation for further details.
