## What is APSG?

APSG is the package for structural geologists. It defines several new python classes to easily manage, analyze and visualize orientational structural geology data.

## Major changes in class names and API from version 1.0.0

APSG has been significantly refactored from version 1.0 and several changes are
breaking backward compatibility. The main APSG namespace provides often-used
classes in lowercase names as aliases to `PascalCase` convention used in
modules to provide a simplified interface for users. The `PascalCase` names of
classes use longer and plain English names instead acronyms for better
readability.

Check [documentation](https://apsg.readthedocs.org) for more details.


## Requirements

You need Python 3.9 or later to run APSG. The package requires [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/),
[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [SciPy](https://scipy.org/), [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)
and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

## Quick start

APSG can be installed using pip:
```
pip install apsg
```
If you want to run the latest version of the code, you can install it from git:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/ondrolexa/apsg.git
```
Alternatively, you can download the package manually from the GitHub repository [https://github.com/ondrolexa/apsg](https://github.com/ondrolexa/apsg), unzip it, navigate into the package, and use the command:
```
python setup.py install
```
or
```
pip install .
```

#### Comments on Debian systems

Latest Debian-based systems does not allow to install non-debian packages system-wide.
However, installing all requirements allows to force install APSG system-wide without troubles.

Install requirements using apt:
```
sudo apt install python3-numpy python3-matplotlib python3-scipy python3-sqlalchemy python3-pandas
```

and then install apsg using pip:
```
pip install --break-system-packages apsg
```

#### Upgrading via pip

To upgrade an existing version of APSG from PyPI, execute
```
pip install apsg --upgrade --no-deps
```
Please note that the dependencies (Matplotlib, NumPy and SciPy) will also be upgraded if you omit the `--no-deps` flag; use the `--no-deps` ("no dependencies") flag if you don't want this.

### Conda

The APSG package is also available on `conda-forge` channel.

#### Installing apsg

Installing `apsg` from the `conda-forge` channel can be achieved by adding `conda-forge` to your channels with:

```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```

Once the `conda-forge` channel has been enabled, `apsg` can be installed with:

```
conda install apsg
```

It is possible to list all of the versions of `apsg` available on your platform with:

```
conda search apsg --channel conda-forge
```
